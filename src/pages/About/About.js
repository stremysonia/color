                                Florida area where the mix of various cultures has made me the person I
                                am today. My career has been spent working two years in the social
                                service in drug treatment and ten years in various customer service
                                roles. I enjoyed my time in these career fields but I realized I wanted
                                to help more people on a larger scale. So, I decided to make a career
                                change and attended Wyncode Academy where I graduated with a certificate
                                in Full Stack Web Development. After graduating I have been sharpening
                                my skills to be the best Front End Web Developer I can be. I have
                                finally found the career that will blend my passion for creativity and my
                                love for technology.
